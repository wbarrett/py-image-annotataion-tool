Image annotation tool, supporting bitmap and bounding box, and whole image (positive/negative/skip) annotations

The tool was written in Python with PyQT4, and called XRanT (X-Ray Annotation Tool) for annotating multi-view X-ray images. This version assumes a directory structure, annotation file format, etc.. Please go to Source > Browse > trunk > doc and see XRanT-Guide.pdf for a user manual.

The goal of this project is to adapt the code to obtain a simple, easy-to-use general purpose image annotation tool.
